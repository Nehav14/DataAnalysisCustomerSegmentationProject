SELECT MIN(session_end - session_start) FROM sessions WHERE trip_id IS NOT NULL;

Assuming a Normal Distribution, how many observations do we expect to be within 2 standard deviations of the mean?
95%

select avg(page_clicks) from sessions;

In which case is the MinMax scaling formula equivalent to dividing by the max?
when the min is 0

Why are there NULL values in the sessions.trip_id field?
